# eNanoMapper Data Portal

## Overview

The eNanoMapper Data Portal is a public platform providing access to nanomaterials characterization data and associated biological and toxicological information. It is designed to support research in nanotoxicology, materials science, and related fields by offering standardized and structured data resources.

## Features

* **Data Exploration**: Browse and search for nanomaterials, biological endpoints, and experimental data.
* **Data Access**: Download datasets in multiple standard formats (CSV, JSON) and access programmatically via the eNanoMapper API.
* **Metadata**: Detailed information about experiments, measurement protocols, and data quality.
* **Integration**: Designed for use with data analysis workflows in Python, R, and other data science environments.

## Usage

1. **Exploration**: Use the portal's search and filter tools to locate relevant nanomaterials and data.
2. **Download**: Obtain datasets in desired formats for analysis.
3. **API Access**: Programmatic retrieval of data for automated workflows.
4. **Preprocessing and Analysis**: Clean, normalize, and analyze data using standard data science tools.

## Example Workflow (Python)

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load a downloaded dataset from the portal
data = pd.read_csv('nanomaterials_data.csv')

# Inspect data
print(data.head())
print(data.columns)

# Example preprocessing
data = data.dropna()
data['normalized_property'] = data['property'] / data['property'].max()
```
