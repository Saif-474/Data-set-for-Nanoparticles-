# RTI Nanomaterial Registry

## Overview

The RTI Nanomaterial Registry is a structured database designed to capture minimal information about nanomaterials, including their physicochemical characteristics, metadata, and experimental provenance. It provides a standardized framework for storing, exploring, and analyzing nanomaterial data, supporting research in nanotoxicology, materials science, and related fields.

## Features

* **Structured Data**: Captures chemical composition, size, shape, surface chemistry, and other key nanomaterial properties.
* **Metadata & Provenance**: Includes information about experimental protocols, measurement units, and source studies.
* **Standardization**: Implements Minimal Information About Nanomaterials (MIAN) guidelines to ensure data consistency.
* **Query & Exploration**: Users can search for specific nanomaterials or filter based on properties and experimental conditions.
* **Data Access**: Selected data subsets may be downloadable, and programmatic access is possible depending on access permissions.

## Usage

1. **Exploration**: Browse the registry to find nanomaterials of interest and examine their properties and experimental metadata.
2. **Data Retrieval**: Download or request subsets of data for further analysis.
3. **Integration**: Incorporate retrieved data into Python or R workflows for statistical analysis, visualization, or machine learning.

## Example Workflow (Python)

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load a retrieved nanomaterial dataset
data = pd.read_csv('nanomaterial_registry_subset.csv')

# Inspect data
print(data.head())
print(data.columns)

# Example preprocessing
data = data.dropna()
data['normalized_size'] = data['size'] / data['size'].max()
```
