## Purpose
The repository is designed to:

- Centralize publicly available LNPS datasets  
- Facilitate AI-based predictive modeling and optimization  
- Provide researchers with ready-to-use data for analysis and benchmarking  

---

## Dataset Contents
The collection includes:

- **System parameters:** Electrical characteristics such as voltage, current, resistance, capacitance, inductance, and noise parameters  
- **Design configurations:** Circuit topologies, component placements, and materials  
- **Performance metrics:** Efficiency, noise levels, thermal behavior, and power consumption  
- **Time-series measurements:** Collected under varying operating conditions  

**Format:**  
- CSV and Excel files for tabular data  
- JSON for metadata and structured information  
- `.mat` or `.npy` files for time-series or high-resolution measurements
