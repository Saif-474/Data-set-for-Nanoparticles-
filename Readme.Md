## Dataset Description
The dataset includes:

- **System parameters:** Electrical characteristics such as voltage, current, resistance, capacitance, inductance, and noise parameters.  
- **Design configurations:** Various LNPS circuit topologies, component placements, and material types.  
- **Performance metrics:** Efficiency, noise levels, thermal behavior, and power consumption under different operating conditions.  
- **Time-series data:** Measurements collected over varying operational conditions to enable predictive modeling.

**Format:**  
- CSV files for tabular data  
- JSON files for structured metadata  
- Optional `.mat` or `.npy` files for high-resolution time-series measurements
